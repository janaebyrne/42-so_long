april 21st:

made a file maps.c which is able to read a map and add it to the map array in the t_complete data structure (defined in header)
started working on validate_map file which will check the map is valid
so far it:
checks the top and bottom and sides are all walls


August 17th:
finished map validation and made a main.c file to test it - it works
checks that its a rectangle / 
checks that there is a valid path
checks that there is at leasr one exit, 1 collectable and one starting position/

starting tryingg to test my so_long file which opens a window but came into trouble when compiling because it did not find x11 development libraries
need to compile with path to minilibx from users/janaebyrne etc

august 18th:

compiled successfully with following :
 gcc -o solong game_logic/so_long.c -I./headers -I/Users/janaebyrne/42Berlin/solong/solong42-/minilibx-mac -L/Users/janaebyrne/42Berlin/solong/solong42-/minilibx-mac -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit

 this is to test so long

 it works and opens a window with a black background
i will need to edit the library and some commands when moving back to linux


continued august 18th:
made a file called picture.c which will be used to draw the map
updated so long file 
main.c now validates the map and then opens the window




other to dos:

Check header
link libft and getnextline
check for incorrect use of functions (e.g. printf)
then figure out how to parse the valid map into graphical environment
error management for if error is encountered - must exit in a clean way

makefile



key command:
gcc -o solong game_logic/so_long.c -I./headers -I/opt/X11/include -L/Users/janaebyrne/42Berlin/solong/solong42-/minilibx -lmlx -L/opt/X11/lib -lX11 -lXext -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
